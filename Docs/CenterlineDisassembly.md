# Centerline disassembly

This module can split a bifurcated centerline model into multiple components. It can create centerline models and centerline curves.

The input centerline must have been created with the 'Extract centerline' module.

This module makes use of the 'Extract centerline' module to generate curves.

### Usage

Select a centerline model node, the components to extract, the output type and apply. The result can be browsed in the 'Models' and 'Markups' modules' widgets.

The components of a centerline can be:

      - bifurcations,
      - branches, i.e,  centerline parts that exclude the bifurcations,
      - centerlines, i.e, one complete centerline from the first endpoint to every other endpoint.
