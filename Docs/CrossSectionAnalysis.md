# Cross-section analysis

This module displays and quantifies cross-sections along a curve (VMTK centerline model, VMTK centerline markups curve, an arbitrary markups curve or a [Shape](https://github.com/chir-set/SlicerExtraMarkups/tree/main/Shape/) markups node as a Tube).

Main features:

- centre on the centerline point in slice view during browsing
- orthogonal slice view reformat
- spin the slice view by an arbitrary amount
- define an arbitrary centerline point as origin
- go to defined origin
- go to minimum and maximum MIS diameter
- go to minimum and maximum cross-section area
- show the maximum inscribed sphere
- show the cross-section

Computed metrics:

- distance of points from an arbitrarily defined origin
- RAS or LPS coordinates of the points
- maximum inscribed sphere (MIS) diameter, as computed by 'Extract centerline'
- cross-section area of a surface
- circular equivalent (CE) diameter, derived from the cross-section area
- orientation of a slice view

If a Shape node (Tube) is used as input, its invisible axial spline is the centerline and the wall is the arterial bounds. It allows to :

- determine the arterial cross-section surface area and diameter at each point
- relate to the lumen's measurements at each point, i.e, calculate the stenosis distribution.

## User interface

### Input centerline

This can be
 - a VMTK centerline model
 - a VMTK centerline markups curve
 - an arbitrary markups curve
 - a Shape::Tune markups node

### Input surface

A model or a segment may be an optional input. Cross-section area and its derived circular equivalent diameter will then be available at each point.

### Output table

An output table providing distance of points from relative centerline origin, MIS diameter, CE diameter and cross-section area at each point. Point coordinates are also recorded. The table's visibility can be easily toggled.

### Output plot

A graphical plot of MIS diameter, CE diameter or cross-section area against distance from relative origin can also be viewed.

## Notes

- The parameter set node is intended for distinct combinations of centerlines and surfaces to isolate a study.
- Point coordinates can be displayed as an array in a single column, or split in three distinct columns. One can choose between RAS or LPS coordinates.
- A markups curve may also lie outside a surface.
- Providing a surface (segmentation or model) is optional. For example, a markups curve may be drawn on a vascular structure's boundary in slice views, to see the corresponding cross-sections only.
- The meaning of a surface area is subject to its requirement. For tubular surfaces for instance, orthogonal section is a requirement.
- Reslicing can be performed as cross-section along the centerline, or in orthogonal planes at each centerline point (adjusted with the 'Spin' slider).
- When using a Shape node as a Tube :
    - the Tube should be nicely drawn, avoid kinking in particular,
    - the lumen should be cut to slightly exceed the ends of the Tube, remove all bifurcations and distant parts of the segment that are not enclosed in the Tube.
- The quality of a segmented lumen is important. It must not contain holes. These may be misleading as the calculated surface area may concern a hole and not the segmented lumen. These defects may be identified and tracked in the module. For a segmentation lumen surface, the 'Paint' effect of the 'Segment editor' may be activated in-place to fill the holes. Alternatively, the input segment may be replaced by its largest region.
